<p>Chapter 2 introduced students to our initial framework for a Capitalist economy. The framework guides our analysis of the economy and helps us ask important questions about the stages and actors in that framework. We described an economic system guided by profit expectations. This raises a logical follow-up question: Just where do these profits come from? This question, it turns out, has a straight-forward answer. But, it will be one that you have largely been trained not to like and/or not to see. Profits, in a Capitalist economy, necessarily take the form of money. Therefore, to truly understand where profits come from in the system, we first need to understand how money gets created AND who gets to do the creating. Here we go.</p>
<p>At this point, we are going to modify our framework from Chapter 2. Recall our discussion of frameworks both in class and previously in this text. Frameworks are tools to focus our attention, to guide our analysis in a thoughtful way. However, frameworks come at a price: they make us forget about what we do not see.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Frameworks help us ask relevant and often powerful questions about the elements of the system we have put in play, but it is damn near impossible for us to ask questions about actors/stages/processes in the world that are not a part of our framework. And so, in this chapter we begin the process that we will continue throughout this book: we build the framework up.</p>
Figure 3.1 below takes our framework from Chapter 2 and properly locates “the State” as a powerful and central actor to this story. This diagram illustrates what I expect to come as no surprise: the state, or the administrative actors of the country, are just as important to the functioning of any economic system as the Worker, the Capitalist, or the Banker.

<p>At this point, we need to answer an important question: Where does that money in Stage 1 come from? In general, the money we use in our economy comes from two places: the State and banks. National governments - at least those that issue their own currency - create new money every time they spend (see the dashed line moving from the State to Stage 1 in Figure 3.1 above). Now, this is one of those places where I’m going to ask you to unlearn something:<strong>The Government spends first and taxes back later</strong>. Put more directly, <strong>The Government doesn’t need your tax dollars to spend its dollar</strong>. Read that again and sit with it for a second….</p>
<p>You know the logic of this statement already, and yet every fiber of your being is pushing back against this fact. Think it through and let logic and reason win. To paraphrase Matt Damon in <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_martian">The Martian</a>, “Let’s logic the s#%* out of this”,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Government is the sole issuer of the U.S. dollar.</li>
<li>No one else can produce the U.S. dollar (or they go to jail for a long time!)</li>
<li>We are required to pay taxes in the U.S. dollar.</li>
<li>To pay the taxes in the U.S. dollar, we first have to accumulate those dollars from the economy.</li>
<li>This means, logically, the dollars must be in the economy first, before anyone can pay their taxes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Government spending happens first. Taxes happen later. It’s logic.</p>
<p>Every time the Government buys goods or services from the economy, it creates new money and sends it to household bank accounts and business bank accounts all across the country. Once that money is spent on goods/services/wages, that money is then used to buy other stuff (paper, cars, child care, computers, etc.). And this process keeps going. That new injection of money from the Government just keeps getting used by people and business throughout the economy. At the end of the year, we then calculate our income tax returns and pay taxes with the U.S. dollars we have accumulated.</p>
<p>So, if taxes aren’t necessary for the State to spend, why tax at all? There are a few important reasons<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, but the core reason is to ensure that there is a demand for State’s currency. Think about it. The State wants us to do things for it. It wants roads, schools, fire fighters, buildings, etc. To get us to do those things it has two options: carrot or stick. The stick is the State’s police force. It can throw you in jail if you don’t do what it tells you to. But, force is hard to sustain. More importantly though, what is to keep the police force itself from turning on the state? The carrot. The State says, “You must pay a tax every year and you must pay it in my currency.” In doing this, the State ensures that we all (including the police forces) will try to go do things that earn U.S. dollars. Those things are things the State wants us to do. We do them; we get paid; and then we can pay our taxes. But wait! Taxes do more still!</p>
<p><strong>Taxes create the private sector</strong>. Yeah, that’s another one where every fiber of your being is trying to push back. But, again, let logic prevail. Recognize what happens when we, as individuals, all try to go earn U.S. dollars so that we can pay our tax. We all have a common tax requirement and we all have to pay those taxes in U.S. dollars. But, that doesn’t mean we all have to work directly for the Government to get those dollars. Assume for a moment that you are a great cook. You love cooking things for others. But, you currently work on a road construction crew. Well, instead of working directly for that crew you could open up a restaurant instead. That crew can take their U.S. dollars they earn from working for the State and come and spend that money with you in exchange for an awesome meal. The better your restaurant skills are, the more your culinary empire grows. Soon the teachers are spending their money with you, then the firefighters, police officers, bus drivers, etc. You are accumulating U.S. dollars but <strong>not</strong> from doing work explicitly for the government. And, with those dollars you can pay your tax. That’s a pretty incredible thing. <strong>Taxes both create demand for the State’s currency and it ensures that we all use that currency with each other!</strong></p>
<p>Now, this brings us closer to the answer on profits. But let’s explore this idea of the tax a bit further yet. Now that we understand what is happening with a tax, it makes sense to ask “how large is the tax”? Let’s look at the extremes: tax back 100% of the dollars spent into the economy by the State. Think about what that does. Everything you earn working for the State directly or indirectly with your restaurant is taxed back…well that would be really stupid by the State. That doesn’t leave anything left for people to use on their own. If the currency has no use beyond paying taxes (and not going to prison) then we all might as well revolt right now. Now, go to the other extreme. Assume the government doesn’t tax at all. Well, then that currency is effectively useless (good for burning and arts and crafts proejcts with the kids though!). So, clearly taxes must be somewhere in the middle. This is just strategy. Low taxes bring risks (too much of the currency in the system OR too few goods and services being produced for the State), but High taxes bring risks too (higher risk of citizen anger - unless you offset other costs in exchange for the high taxes, e.g. make college and/or health care free). There isn’t an “optimal” answer here, at least not in the real world. But, whatever you decide does have some implications for profit expectations and profit realization in the economy.</p>
<p>Profits cannot exist in an economy without money. I know I just keep throwing these bombs at you, but again think it through. Profits happen when a private producer (you the restaurateur) accumulates State money in excess of the State money you originally advanced for the business. Out of those profits you pay your tax to the State. What remains then are your <strong>net profits</strong>. What happens if the State doesn’t leave much money in the system (i.e. higher income taxes)? Well, then there are fewer dollars left in the economy to be divided between the wages paid to workers and the profits that accrue to Capitalists. Therefore, there is a direct link between profits and Government spending. More spending means more profits, period. This will largely depend on the <strong>distribution of income</strong> though. If the wage share of output (<span class="math display">\[\frac{W}{Y}\]</span>) is large, then the additional profits available from the additional State spending will be relatively small. However, if the wage share is low then the pool of profits will increase substantially with each new round of Government spending. This concept of the distribution of income will play a central role in this course; my hope is that this story starts to illustrate why.</p>
<p>So, we have one part of the answer to our question: Where do profits come from? That first answer is: State money and the tax requirement. State money is spent into a system where we all go after the same currency. In that environment, profits can accrue to some individuals. Now, that’s only part of the answer though. The second part of the answer is that profits are created when Banks create money, so-called “Bank money”. And they do this every time they lend. Let’s walk through it.</p>
</div>
<div id="bank-money" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="4.0.1.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.0.1.2</span> Bank Money<a href="the-role-of-profits-in-a-capitalist-economy.html#bank-money" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The second part of the money creation story comes from the financial sector: Bank money. Here again, you’re going to need to unlearn a few things about banks. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Banks do not lend out of deposits</strong>. Your bank does not take the money in your savings account and lend it out. That is a myth. In fact, is has essentially never been the case for banks (whether they use the U.S. dollar, gold, or some other money thing). So what do banks do then?</p>
<p>Let’s say you don’t have enough State dollars saved under your mattress to fund your restaurant. So, you go to a bank. You bring them your business plan and it looks great. They approve your loan for $100,000. To emphasize the point, <strong>the bank does not take $100,000 out of someone else’s deposit account</strong>. It simply adds $100,000 to your account AND then adds $100,000 to its ledger on the accounts receivable side (i.e. it tracks that you owe the bank $100k). Where did that money come from? Thin air. They just created the money through their keyboard. That’s it.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>At this point, the Bank has created <strong>money</strong>, which Abba Lerner defined as “What we use to buy things.” Now that your account is flush, you’ve successfully completed Stage 1! Good work! So you move on to stage 2. You start spending that money. And every time you spend that money you’re creating incomes for others (both in wages and profits). And that money stays in the system as a part of the “money supply”. It stays in the system until you start making loan payments. Every time you make a payment you are actually taking money out of the economy (i.e. paying off a loan is just like paying your tax bill). So, every time a bank creates a loan (which happens a lot!) new money is being injected into the economy. Unlike State money though, Bank money is temporary. Everything that is created is eventually destroyed when the loan is paid in full. State money, that isn’t taxed back, actually stays in the economy.</p>
<p>Now we have the second part of our answer to the question, “Where do profits come from?” At its most basic level, profits are generated when money is created. New dollars are made available for use in the economy and as those dollars are spent, they create incomes for others - part of which goes to wages and the other part to profits. More specifically, the two sources of profits are <em>Government Expenditure</em> by the State and <em>Loans</em> by banks.</p>
<p>Figure 3.2 below illustrates both expenditure items and includes <em>Corporate profits before taxes</em>. Take a look at it. Which series does corporate profits seem to move with the most? Why is the corporate profits line less than both the Government Expenditures and Bank Loans and Leases?<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

</p>
</div>
<p>There you have it. Profits are created when new money is spent into the economy AND is left in the economy at least temporarily. That’s the simple answer. But, this answer just tells us where it comes from, it doesn’t help us understand the factors that determine the <em>level</em> of profits in the economy. For that, we turn to the <strong>Kalecki Profit Equation</strong>.</p>
