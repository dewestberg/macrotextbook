Westberg 2022-10-19 Preface 0.1 What is this? This is the textbook for Prof. Westberg’s Introduction to Macroeconomics course. It is a book for college students, not for college profs. This book will be published as an open-source text when it is complete. It is ultimately intended to help my students learn how the economy works, how that affects their lives, and what they can do about it. I’ll cut to the quick: the Economy does what it is designed to do. Many of my economic colleagues would disagree with that statement, but look at the structure of unemployment by race, age, gender, and class over the past 18 years of your lives and ask a simple question: Why doesn’t this ever change? It isn’t because there is something inherently different in the productivity of these groups. Rather, it’s grounded in the different ways that these groups are perceived in economic (and social-political) situations. In other words, these groups are treated differently by the economy because the people who ultimately wrote and are rewriting the economic rules see those groups differently. Whether they realize it or not, the rule writers almost always write rules to benefit their own groups.1 We live in highly politicized times. I have no doubt that many of you reading this have already formed some idea of what is in this book, and this class, from the preceding paragraph. Let me, perhaps, surprise you: whether you think this book will fit into some lefty-liberal agenda or some right-wing populist revolt, you’d be right. This book is political. All books are. But, the approach I will teach you forces all of us to engage our core beliefs, to interrogate them, and to be willing to find them lacking. What if your most cherished political belief turns out to be useless at best (i.e. “free markets”) or just flat out wrong at worst (i.e. “banks lend out of deposits”)? Well, in this class, you’ll learn to accept it and move on. My only ask of you this: recognize you come to this class with your own ideology, beliefs, and expectations - we all do, including me! - but be willing to take these on. Be skeptical but learn to be logical. This book is intended to give you to the tools to understand how the economy is designed to work, what drives it, and how that shapes the world we live in. My sincere hope is that you are one day able to use it to reshape the economy to produce the kind of outcomes that you want to see in the world your generation constructs. I believe it is possible; I hope you do to. 0.2 Who am I? I have been teaching Principles of Macroeconomics for nearly a decade now. I’ve taught the course over 30 times to nearly 1,000 students. In that time, I have moved farther and farther away from standard Macroeconomics textbooks, pushing my course content to more aptly reflect the pressing questions of today’s students: climate change, income inequality, racial justice, power, and money (interest in that one never seems to go away :) ). That move has been a success both in terms of student achievement and student satisfaction. In fact, in 2021 I was honored to receive the Charles J. Lynch Outstanding Teacher Award at Coe College. I say this to give you confidence in what I am teaching you. Whether you’re a Democrat, a Republican, or something else entirely, the economy still shapes your life and I’m here to show you how that happens. This book is about teaching and learning. It is meant to be accessible, not another barrier to learning challenging content. I will supplement it with recorded lectures, PowerPoint slides, and in-class discussions. But, the essentials of the content will be here. If you love math, there are chapters for you here. If you hate math but love story, there are chapters here for you too. And I promise to do my best to help both camps get through their respective fears. I am also a father of two young, amazing humans: June and Michael. This book is as much for them as it is for you. I want them to live in a better world, a more just world, a sustainable world, and a world grounded in Democracy and equality of opportunity. They will live in the world you and I create…so the pressure, so to speak, is on. 0.3 Why this book? There are two reasons for this book. First and foremost, it is for you. Part of my movement away from textbooks was the cost to students. It was pretty wild to ask students to pay hundreds for a textbook that didn’t speak to them. It was a little better to just use old versions of those books to save money. But, those books have grown increasingly out of date and out of touch too. As I have continued to move away from textbooks in my class, it has made it more challenging for some students to stay connected to the material. Though PowerPoints can help, students need more and varied points of connection to both learn concepts and put them into practice. To that end, I have written this book for you (and it’s free!). Second, the standard macroeconomics textbook has grown increasingly vapid over time. College students today face a world of myriad crises: inequality, debt, guns, pandemics, declining psychological health, growing social dysfunction, and oh yeah, the planet is on @#*%&amp;@# fire (FYI the following link does contain explicit language from Bill Nye the Science Guy). Yet, the current stock of macroeconomics textbooks won’t teach you how to incorporate income distribution into the foundation of your analysis; they won’t show you how the economy interacts with the environment; and they certainly won’t help you understand the political economy of power. And so, my second purpose for this book is write a book that actually addresses some of the very real and daunting challenges that lie ahead for us: you, me, my children, and yours. This is a book about The Economy &amp; Us. 0.4 My Approach My approach to the economy and to teaching has been shaped by many economists across a wide range of so-called schools of thought. As a theorist though, I find myself coming back to the work of Elinor (“Lin”) Ostrom, the first woman to win the coveted Nobel Prize in Economics.2 Though her award focused on her main academic conclusion - “complexity is not the same as chaos” - it is her approach to theory construction that has always stood out to me. Specifically, Prof. Ostrom argues that theory construction should rest on a specific architecture: a framework, a set of theories, and models that illustrate those theoretical connections. As noted by one of Ostrom’s former colleagues, Michael McGinnis (2011) a, Framework identifies, categorizes, and organizes those factors deemed most relevant to understanding some phenomenon. Theory posits general causal relationships among some subsets of these variables or categories of factors, designating some types of factors as especially important and others as less critical for explanatory purposes. Model specifies the specific functional relationships among particular variables or indicators that are hypothesized to operate in some well-defined set of conditions. We will rely on this architecture to structure the book and our examination of the various theoretical perspectives on “the economy”. In doing so, my hope is that you will be better able to think critically about the economic answers that dominate our personal media environments. 0.5 Structure of the Book The book will adhere to Ostrom’s architecture. First, we will lay out the framework and attempt to fully understand its varied components, its data, and its definitions. Then we will move into the theory and modelling stages. In Part I, we will spend some time learning to talk about what the economy is and what it does. Then, we will move to construct a framework of the economy. Initially, this framework will be quite incomplete. However, we will add to it as we move through the material, learning along the way just how important a framework is to problem solving and thinking through complexity.3 With a framework of the macroeconomy in place, Part II of the book will move us into Classical Economic Theory, i.e. the set of causal relationships between the variables in our framework that were adhered to (believed in?) by so-called “Classical Economists”. This theoretical approach dominated economic theorizing for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Once we understand the core Classical Theoretical beliefs, we will move to construct the Classical Model, which is an analytical tool that illustrates the Classical Theory in action. We will use this model to illustrate how economists think. We will explain the past, examine the present, and predict the future. The Classical Theory was a useful explanation of the economy for its time. But, as is typical in human history, this view of the world eventually stopped being able to explain it effectively. The Great Depression presented something that did not exist within Classical Theory - prolonged involuntary unemployment. Thankfully, a small cohort of economists in Britain had been slowly tearing themselves apart from this outdated view in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Three names in particular are worth mentioning here: Keynes, Kalecki, and Robinson. These economists helped shape and ultimately export what came to be known as “Keynesian Economics”, the subject of Part III of the course, to the rest of the world. Here, we will explore the emergence of a new set of theoretical propositions that came to be known as Keynesian Theory. This approach to the economy was quite different from Classical Theory. In almost every way, the Keynesian approach turned the Classical Theory upside down (or perhaps better described as “right-side up”). This new theory became dominant in most economic circles from the late 1930s into the late 1960s. From there, the theoretical paths diverged rather dramatically. Most economics textbooks take students down a path that frankly doesn’t yield much fruit - and that’s putting it rather kindly. Instead, this book will diverge at that point and move students’ thinking toward more relevant questions of this age, using more comprehensive tools and more empirically validated theories. With these tools in place, we will explore big questions: What is the impact of income inequality on the economy? How can the economy and the environment be connected? Is there a connection between inequality writ large and the environmental catastrophe we are all living in the midst of already? My hope is that you, the student, will find this material engaging, accessible, but most importantly, relevant. It will not be an easy journey, but deep learning never is. 0.6 The Importance of Goals At this point, I’m going to ask you to read the Introduction and Ch. 1 The Gross Domestic Product out of an incredibly important book, What’s the Economy For Anyway?. The book asks a central question. The answer is for all of us to determine together and that is the power behind simply asking the question. It presumes that there can be an actual answer. The economy therefore is something we can shape, alter, re-orient. For most students and most adults quite frankly, this revelation is hard to fathom. In my experience, most students sense the economy as something like gravity, an external force that is shaping their lives but something far beyond their ability to influence. They just hope to hitch a good ride. The first chapter in that book shows you just how wrong that assumption is; it also helps you start to see how much it benefits political and economic elites when we succumb to this common belief. Once you see that in fact we can make substantive changes, my hope is that you will never “unsee it” again. Let’s look at some outcomes, economic outcomes. I want you to take a few minutes and go to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s aptly named data center, FRED and attempt to plot the following data series: Gross Domestic Output Unemployment Rate We will dive into these measures in more detail in the next chapter. For now, I want you to look carefully at these two major measures that we use to manage the economy. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the overall size of the economy. The Unemployment Rate tells you the percent (%) of all job seekers that aren’t able to find work. These measures, coupled with inflation (again we will dive into that one shortly), give us the big three measures that Macroeconomists use to assess the overall health of the economy. If GDP is bigger than last month/quarter/year, if inflation is right around 2%, and if the Unemployment Rate is around 5%, most Macroeconomists would tell the economy is at Full Employment. Technically, they would tell you that the economy has reached its “Non-accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment”, or put simply, there are enough unemployed people to keep prices from rising too fast. But, let me ask you a question: What is it that we are trying to achieve with an economic system managed around the idea of raising GDP and keeping prices low through a buffer of unemployed people? That’s the big question: what is the goal? These measures of the economy are just measures. They are just indicators that the economy is doing what we have designed it to do. They are a means to some end. But what are the ends of the economy? What do we want it to do? At this point, I’ve already put you in a mental box. Let me show you how. Quickly now, I want you to make a list of the five things you want the economy to do. Do it. Go fast. Now: I’ll bet that most, if not all of you put something about growth, unemployment, and inflation on your lists. You’ve confused economic measures with economic goals. It’s okay. You’ve been trained to do that. Now, let’s undue some of that training. Step outside of the economy for a moment and do a different thought exercise with me. I want you to establish five goals for your life by answering this question: What are the five most important things you need to live a happy, healthy, and flourishing human life? Take your time this time. Think it through, carefully (I’ll share my five things with you in class). Now, how many of you wrote something like “Make the economy bigger”? I doubt any of you did and that’s the point. The things that matter to you as human beings are much deaper things. Things that revolve around community connection, doing meaningful work, meeting new people and experiencing new places, etc. There is so much that goes into a flourishing human life, and frankly, not nearly enough of those things show up in our measures of the economy. GDP, unemployment, inflation, these are just measures, sign-posts that help us know if we are heading toward our goal(s) or if we are off track. Which brings us to the question of the day: based on the big three measures of the economy, can you tell me what the economic goal(s) is(are)? And, just who’s goals are they? For readers who really want to dive into this right away, I urge you to download Chelwa, Hamilton, and Stewarts latest work on Stratification Economics.↩︎ I encourage you to listen to her 2009 speech here.↩︎ For those of you with little patience, the key takeaway is that our frameworks define what questions can be asked. For example, if the environment does not exist in your framework, then how important are you likely to think it is in effecting your problem of concern? Simply put, you would never even think to ask!↩︎ "],["measuring-the-economy-means-as-ends-or-means-to-ends.html", "Chapter 1 Measuring the Economy: Means as Ends or Means to Ends? 1.1 Purpose &amp; Learning Objectives 1.2 Just how big is it? 1.3 Conclusion", " Chapter 1 Measuring the Economy: Means as Ends or Means to Ends? 1.1 Purpose &amp; Learning Objectives The purpose of this chapter is to ground our collective ability to describe the economy through a number of important measures, or standards of judgement, that we seem to think are useful indicators that the economy is doing what we want it to do. After reading this chapter, students will be able to: Define Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Articulate the formula for GDP and the relative contributions of each component of GDP to its total value. Critique GDP as a measure and define the Human Development Index (HDI). Describe the difference between a data series that is a “level” vs a “rate”. 1.2 Just how big is it? The first task in any serious examination of a subject is to define the unit of analysis. Here in Macroeconomics, we are analyzing the economy as a whole - what it does, how it works, and how healthy it is. Our starting point for this introduction is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is the main measure of economic activity in the world. We use it to answer a set of specific questions: How big is the economy? Is the economy growing, shrinking, or stable? What sectors are the most important to the economy? 1.2.1 Defining GDP First, let’s define this measure and then we will set out to answer these three questions. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced domestically in a given year. You’ll want to commit that definition to memory. We will come back to it often and you will be tested on it, often. This definition rests on three important terms: market value, final goods and services, and domestically. “Market value”, in economics, is simply the price buyers actually pay for a good or service times the quantity they buy. If you bought 5 cups of coffee this morning at $3.00 a cup, the “market value” of that purchase was $15.00. If a buyer purchased a 100 bushels of wheat to produce some flour at $9.91 a bushel, the market value of that purchase was $991.00. Both of these transactions have a value in the market…BUT, only one of those counts toward GDP - the coffee of course!. Here’s why. GDP relies on the notion of a final good or service. These are goods and services that are purchased to be consumed/used, not to become part of another production process. This latter type of good is called an intermediate good - it is purchased to incorporate into the production process of a final good. For example, rubber is purchased to produce tires. Tires are produced for a new car/truck. The final good here is the car/truck, not the rubber.4 Finally, GDP is constructed on the idea of domestic production. It is a measure of the economic activity happening within a country’s political borders. Businesses from countries from all of the world produce in the United States. All of the final goods produced and sold by those plants and factories operating here in the US count toward the United States’ GDP. The size of their contribution is the market value of their final sales. 1.2.2 Measuring GDP Now that we have some initial clarity on the definition of GDP, let’s see it in action. The agency responsible for measuring and reporting out U.S. GDP is called the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Go there now and try to find the data for GDP.5 In general, just look around for a minute and see just a snapshot of what’s there. We will use Bureau of Economic Analysis a fair bit in the coming weeks. For now, let’s keep practicing with the St. Louis FRED website. Using the search tool, go find the data series for “Gross Domestic Product”. When you do, you should be able to reproduce Figure 1 below. Figure 1.1: US GDP (1947-2021) Let’s explore Figure 1 for a moment. Before you look to closely at the line graph, I want you to look at the X and Y axes. Go slowly here, there’s no rush. Make sure you know what the axes are AND what units they are in. The X-axis is pretty clear: it’s just the year with labels only showing up in 5-year intervals. The Y-axis though might be intimidating for you. If it is, don’t worry and just trust me. Go slowly. There is no rush. The Y-axis is “Billions of Dollars”. That is telling you how many zeros to add to any number that shows up on the Y-axis. For example, if the Y-axis said “Thousands of Dollars”, then any number on the Y-axis would need three zeros added to it - because 1,000 has three zeros. So, $100 becomes $100,000; $1,000 becomes $1,000,000; and $20,000 becomes $20,000,000. We know that one Billion Dollars has nine zeros: $1,000,000,000. So, we need to add nine zeros to any number on the Y-axis. That means that $24,000 Billion Dollars is really $24,000,000,000,000. That’s $24 Trillion dollars … and there you have it, you’ve answered the first question on our list. The U.S. economy is a $24 Trillion dollar economy. That’s how big it is. The second question is also something we can find out with this data series in FRED. When we want to find out if something is growing or not, we calculate its percent change (i.e. its rate of growth) from the levels of its data series. Figure 1 is Gross Domestic Product in levels. It tells us the level of water ($24 Trillion) in the bucket that is the US economy. To calculate a percent change (how much water was added to or drained from the bucket), just use this formula: \\[\\begin{equation} \\%\\Delta = \\frac{New - Old}{Old} * 100 \\end{equation}\\] Equation 1 says that the percent change (signified by the Greek symbol \\(\\Delta\\) - read it as “Delta”) is equal to the newest level value minus the older level value of interest, divided by the older level value of interest. That will give you a basic proportion. Multiplying it by 100 then puts the percent value (aka the rate) in terms we are used to seeing, e.g. 5%. Let’s do one quick example by answering the question: How much did the economy grow (i.e. what rate did GDP grow by) from 2020 to 2021? First, find the level value of GDP for 2021: $22.996 Trillion. Second, find the level value of GDP for 2020: $20.893 Trillion. Now, just use the formula to “plug n chug”. And now we have answered the second question. The economy grew over 6.7% in 2021. Now, on your own, convert the GDP data series in FRED to “percent change”. You should have been able to replicate Figure 2, below. If not, you need to try a few more times but then ask for help. Figure 1.2: US GDP Growth Rates (1945-2021) Figure 2 tells you the story of growth in the US Economy from 1945, which was the conclusion to World War II. The graph really shows a story of two periods of growth. From essentially 1950 - 1978, we see that the growth rate in the economy was increasing (imagine a thick red line that cuts through the middle of the line graph). But, notice from 1978 to 2021 the underlying trend is downward sloping (still positive growth, but increasingly slower growth). This break will be an important one as we examine income inequality in more detail below. For now, just focus on being able to “see” that underlying trendline in your mind’s eye. Figures 1 and 2 give us our first direct comparison between levels and rates. Figure 1 is relatively smooth, with seemingly small movements from one period to the next. Figure 2 though is much more volatile, meaning the movements from one period to the next look large. It definitely is not a smooth line. Now it’s time to answer our third question. Which industries seem to drive GDP in the United States. For that, we need to go to the BEA. Here, we are going to explore “Value Added by Industry” from 2019 through 2021.6 You’ll need to play with this a bit to learn how to use the website effectively. Take that experience seriously. Table 1 below provides a breakdown of GDP (i.e. the total market value of all final goods and services produced domestically - by firms in these industries - in the years of 2019, 2020, and 2021) according to the major industry group classifications. We can use this information to answer our third question that we can use GDP to answer: What industries are driving change in the US economy? When you look at Table 1, look from the top down and pay particular attention to the indents. Notice that “Mining” is below “Private Industries” and indented. That means that “Mining” is a sub-component of “Private Industries”. In other words, you do not compare these two groups. Rather, mining is a piece of the total GDP from Private Industries. But, you can compare “Mining” and “Utilities”. Why? Because they are left-indented to the same extent. Now, using this information look down the list of industries that are contributing to GDP. Which ones seem to matter most? The four industries that contribute the most to GDP are: Finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing, Professional and business services, Government, and Manufacturing I’ve made this list by relying on the levels of their individual contributions to GDP. Look at Table 1 again. Manufacturing produced roughly $2.37 Trillion in final sales in 2019. Now, that’s a big number. And, frankly, it’s a number that means basically nothing to any normal human. So, let’s transform it to something that makes mroe sense: ** a proportion**. To do that, we simply divide the level (i.e. $2.37) by the total economy ($21,373). This ratio is simply asking how big is the total contribution of manufacturing to the US economy? The answer: In 2019, Manufacturing made up just over 11% of the US economy. Take a second and consider what that means to you? Does that seem high? Low? Again, it’s just not that meaningful unless you have something to compare it to. What if I told you that manufacturing’s typical share of GDP for a mid- to large-sized city would be about 20%, what do you think about that 11% figure? Well, okay, that’s not a comparison to a federal government though. So, let’s make a better comparison. Let’s look at manufacturing’s share of GDP in the US over time. Figure 1.3: US Manufacturing as a share of GDP (1997 - 2021) Figure 1.3 tells us quite a few things about manufacturing’s relationship with the US economy. First, we see that manufacturing’s share of GDP has been declining steadily since 1997. It certainly still matters to the overall level of total US output, but it’s becoming less important over time. Second, the rate of decline in manufacturing’s share of GDP is decreasing BUT it is decreasing slower in more recent years. If we extend that curve out (again in your mind’s eye), manufacturing’s share of GDP is approaching a resting place at approximately 10% of GDP. There you have it. We’ve answered our three questions. The US economy is a $24 Trillion economy. It grew at 6.7% from 2020 to 2021. And, the economy is driven by four large industrial sectors (some of which are becoming less important like Manufacturing, while others are becoming much more important like Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate.). 1.2.3 How is this measure constructed? The GDP Identity Now that we’ve been able to use the definition of GDP and some data from the BEA to describe the economy, let’s dive into the structure of GDP. In other words, how do they actually come up with these numbers? One of the most important equations in this class is the equation for GDP. Equation 2 is what we call an Accounting Identity, which is an equation that is true by definition. It tells us how total spending on final goods and services are broken down by their primary actor. \\[\\begin{equation} Y = C + I + G + X - M \\end{equation}\\] Equation 2 tells us that total GDP (“Y”) can be broken down into six components: Household Consumption (C) Business Investment (I) Government Expenditure (G) Total Exports (X) Total Imports (M) These components are not equally important in size, nor in theory. Figure 4 illustrates the relative shares of GDP and their trends over time. Figure 1.4: Spending components of US GDP (1947 - 2021) Household consumption is the total spending on domestically-produced final goods and services by households - by you and me - in a given year. According to Figure 4, our collective spending accounts for nearly 70% of total GDP. Our spending accounts for almost 70% of $24 Trillion…wow, we spend a lot. Notice too, that the share of GDP attributable to household consumption grew considerably from the mid-1950s through 2000. Since 2000, the relative share of GDP has remained essentially unchanged. Business investment is the total spending on domestically-produced final goods and services by firms in a given year. In Figure 4, we see that Business Investment has historically been pretty consistent, between 15% - 21% of GDP each year. This structural relationship has largely been the same since the mid-1990s. Government expenditure is the total spending on domestically-produced final goods and services by state, local, and federal government agencies in the US, in a given year. It’s important to note too, that more than 68% of total Government spending comes from State and Local governments (much of which does come from federal government transfers). Figure 4 shows us a different trend from the previous two lines of interest. Government’s share of GDP has actually been consistently getting smaller since, essentially, 1970. From essentially the 1950s through 1970, total Government spending hovered around 23%. In 2021, that share had fallen to just 17.2%. Total exports represents the final purchases of domestically-produced goods and services that are purchased from outside of US political borders. Canada and Mexico are our largest trade partners, buying largely refined and crude petrolium products. Total exports remained largely stable at around 10% from 1980 into 2010. Following the Great Recession, US exports grew somewhat but largely returned to its 10% level by 2020. Total imports are somewhat different. This data series represents the total domestic purchases of final goods and services not produced domestically in a given year. In other words, how much money people in US jurisdictions send abroad for goods and services. Figure 4 indicates a consistently growing share of imports since the mid-1970s. In 2020, the US purchased over $144 Billion in cars from China, our primary source of imports. We will explore trade relationships in more detail in the coming chapters. For now, I’d encourage you to explore the picture of US exports and imports here. 1.2.4 GDP, HDI, and Inequality So far, we’ve done a solid job of wrapping our heads around the idea of measuring the economy, particularly through Gross Domestic Product. Now, we turn our attention toward a bigger question: Just what does GDP measure? And, how does that align with our (your!) goals? Let’s walk through it. 1.2.4.1 GDP Definitions really do matter. Think about that definition of GDP: the total market value of all final goods and services produced domestically within a given year. What all counts? Well, it turns out, lots of things that are good (money spent on travel, on our health, on our schools) but also lots of things that don’t. But, as Economist John de Graaf says, “Maybe Bobby Kennedy said it best.” Take a listen [here]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FAmr1la6w0). The story of GDP is one worth reading about. That’s why every student that goes through my Principles of Macroeconomics course has to read it. It shows us the importance of measuring what matters. When the measure no longer measures what we care about, it’s time for a new one. That’s how we got to GDP in the first place. Though it isn’t nearly the dominant force that GDP is, a new measure, the Human Development Index aims to counter some of the shortcomings of GDP.7 1.2.4.2 HDI The Human Development Index takes GDP per person (often called “GDP per capita” or “Gross National Income”), avg. lifetime expectancy at birth, and the mean years of schooling for each country. Check out where your country stands on the HDI here. The good people at MeasureofAmerica.org have taken it upon themselves to apply the HDI formula to US states. You can see their rankings as of 2013-2014 on Google Classroom. Take a break from reading now and go check it out. What do you see? How well is this measure doing at articulating how “well” humans are living in US states? HDI, as it turns out, really isn’t as good of a measure of human well-being as we can get. Rather, according to economists and psychologists who study things like happiness and stress, the primary measure of human well-being is income inequality. Take a moment and watch this thought provoking Ted Talk by Epidemiologist Richard Wilkinson. 1.2.4.3 Inequality According to Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, income inequality is deeply connected to social dysfunction. More unequal societies trust less, have more mental illness, and are generally much worse on a variety of “good” things than more equal societies. One of the best places to explore income inequality across the globe is through the OECD. If we are persuaded by Wilkinson, Pickett, and Oishi et al.’s theses, then income inequality must be a central measure to how we view the economy. 1.3 Conclusion In this chapter, we have explored how we measure the size of the economy: Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We can define it. We can measure it. We can visualize it. We can use it to describe how big an economy is, whether that economy is growing or shrinking, and we can use it to understand what kinds of work are driving that economy’s performance. In short, we can say quite a lot about an economy through the measure of GDP. However, we also know that GDP is not everything. In fact, it is just a measure of scale. It says very little about the things that make individual human lives “worth living”, to borrow from Bobby Kennedy. It also can go up for quite bad reasons like, natural disasters, violence, illness, or medical accidents. Just as GNP trasnformed to GDP at one point, some are trying to move us away from GDP toward something like the Human Development Index (HDI). Still, other measures matter too. Are people that want to work able to (i.e. the unemployment rate)? Are prices rising across the economy (i.e. inflation)? If so, how fast/slow? Still, the work of epidemiologists and psychologists point us toward a different measure that seems to matter a great deal more to human life: income inequality. We will keep this measure close at hand as we work through these next few chapters. Our goal now is to understand the economic source of income inequality. Perhaps, if we can figure out where it comes from we might be able to figure out how to combat it. The tires are tricky one. If they are sold with the car, they are not a final good/service. But, if they are sold to a customer to replace an existing tire, they are a final good/service.↩︎ Look under the heading “Data by Topic” and then “Interactive Data”.

Understand the location and centrality of work within that economic framework. Begin to articulate the internal dependencies that Capitalism creates and reproduces. 2.2 The Structure of a Modern Capitalist Economy Our social provisioning process, our economy, is organized around the private ownership of the means of production, markets, and purchased labor. This is Capitalism. One of the simplest but most powerful descriptions of the structure of Capitalism was delivered by the economist, Karl Marx (1867, Ch- 4 and 1885, Chapter 1). Here Marx used a schema that he referred to as the The Circuit of Capital. His circuit had three distinct stages of “Capital Accumulation”. Let’s explore those in more detail. Stage 1: A Capitalist uses money (M) to purchase labor power (LP) and the means of production (MP). \\[\\begin{equation} M -&gt; LP, MP \\end{equation}\\] Stage 2: Labor power and the means of production are combined in the process of production to produce a commodity of greater “value” (C’) than that of its inputs. \\[\\begin{equation} C(L, MP) ... P - C&#39; \\end{equation}\\] Stage 3: The Capitalist takes the newly produced commodity to the market, selling it for more money (M’) than was originally invested (M). \\[\\begin{equation} C&#39;-M&#39; \\end{equation}\\] The entire process is described by economic geographer and Marx scholar David Harvey as, “capital in motion.” Its central driving motivation, the force underpinning a functioning capitalist economy, is the expectation of profit. Combining these stages, we see the system as a whole, but we can also begin to uncover the embedded social relations that Marx saw as fundamental to Capitalism. This is capital accumulation - the process of creating profit: \\[\\begin{equation} M - C(L,MP)... P - C&#39; - M&#39; \\end{equation}\\] In the first stage of the process of capital accumulation Capitalists make two important decisions. The first is whether or not to produce. Why would a Capitalist make this decision? Well, the schema tells us. Members of the Capitalist class will/should only engage in commodity creation if they expect to make more money (M’) than they initially invested (M). In other words, they would only engage in production if they expect to make profits. The second decision is a question of how to finance the project. Capitalists could get a loan from a bank, they could get seed money from equity investors, they could issue bonds, sell stocks, and even seek out venture capital (like on Shark Tank). If the Capitalist expects to make profits and is able to find financing, she then moves on to the second stage of capital accumulation: production. In the second stage, the Capitalist combines labor and the means of production to carry out the process of production; this takes time and emphasizes the role of labor and technology in production but also in Capitalism writ large. Considering the role of an economy in a society or culture, the position of labor in Capitalism is quite intriguing. Workers produce all of the goods and services that a society needs to fulfill its institutionalized daily tasks. They are critical to the production of goods and services necessary for society to reproduce itself. Without these workers (and the Capitalists that hired them), at least in this schematic, the society would not be able to reproduce itself as it was designed to do. This stage of production relies heavily on the workers (how healthy they are, how educated they are, how dependable they are, how happy they are etc.), the technology embedded within the means of production (machinery, equipment, buildings, land, public infrastructure, etc.), and the natural resources associated with that geographic space (climate, water quality, aesthetic appeal, etc.). Assuming the workers can do the work and are willing to do so at the wage on offer and that the means of production they are using are sufficient to produce the intended commodities, this second stage will proceed accordingly to stage three: consumption. Finally, the third stage occurs when the capitalist takes the commodity created by the combination of labor and technology to the market. This stage is critical to the capitalist. She must sell the commodity for an amount of money that covers all of her prior expenses (M) and provides her with profits (M’ &gt; M). If this stage works properly, consumers (which are just workers after they’ve been paid) purchase the goods and services on offer at the prices required to create profit (M’ &gt; M). If successful, the members of society now have the goods and services they require to meet the needs of their social lives and continue the process of reproducing this society. This approach to describing the structure of the macro economy helps us consider three critical questions. How does this economic structure affect the social relations within that society? What tensions or problems emerge from the ongoing reproduction of this chain of capital? How does this system work on an interconnected global scale? 2.3 The Social Relations to and from Production The process of production is at the core of your daily life, whether you know it or not. The time we get up, the way we interact with our friends and family, the types of jobs and careers we pursue are all intricately connected with the process of production in this Capitalist economy. The lives of people in developing countries are no different, but the process of production is. At its core, Capitalism is all about generating and reproducing dependent relationships. Those dependencies are critical to establishing and maintaining power dynamics. Let’s explore those dependencies in more detail. 2.3.0.1 Stage 1: Financing The fist stage of capital accumulation - financing - includes two actors: Capitalists and their financiers. Those financiers provide the liquidity to start the process of capital accumulation, and their money can come from a wide range of sources. The most common form of financing for small endeavors still is the traditional bank loan. But, firms can also use their own savings - called “retained earnings” - or they might issue bonds of their own. However, larger firms and firms in the fast paced world of start up enterprises often seek out non-bank equity investors. Each of these options requires different strategies, different types of projects, etc. But, the common thread between them is the financier is in the driver’s seat. The Capitalist is dependent upon the financial sector to gain access to the money she needs to get production up and running. This has several important implications for production (and consequently for daily life). First, the financial sector must be able to provide liquidity - money - to Capitalists. This means the financial sector must be “healthy” and must be willing to part with its own liquidity. Second, the financial sector is in a position to decide which projects get funding and which do not. Moreover, the financiers are in position to make demands on returns too. This may alter the Capitalist’s initial designs. Higher returns from investors may require Capitalists to cut costs, push more productivity from workers, use lower quality materials, etc. Finally, the financial sector must be trusted by the Capitalist enough to enter into a mutually-beneficial (one would expect) agreement. 2.3.0.2 Stage 2: Production The dependent relationships in stage two - production - are quite different. The production process relies directly on three distinct roles (capitalists, workers, and the owners of the necessary means of production (aka other Capitalists).). Capitalists must directly or indirectly oversee the production process. This includes hiring employees, managers, CEOs, etc. It also requires the development of rules and regulations that organize the working day and environment, the quality of the goods and services being produced, marketing plans, location decisions, etc. The list is expansive, but a good manager hires talented people to take over those roles. They hire employees with the technical skills, problem solving skills, and communication skills needed to do the job well, and try to maximize the difference between (M’ - M). The means of production that matter most are the tools workers use to produce the product. Whether these tools are hydraulic lifts, computers, software, fabric, sewing machines, paint, etc. the point is that the workers interact with these tools (including their physical work spaces) to engage in, and complete the production process. But, they are producing a product with someone else’s equipment. They are producing output that they do not own. This stage represents a variety of dependencies. The first relationship exists clearly between the Capitalist and the worker. Without the Capitalist’s decision to engage in production and enter into an agreement with agents in the financial sector, the circuit of capital would not start in the first place, leaving the worker unemployed. Worse still, if the worker is unemployed they cannot get access to the money they need to live their social lives. This can be potentially devastating to the worker, but workers will also have people that depend on them (e.g. kids, partners, older parents, siblings with mental/physical disabilities, etc.). Capitalists, on the other hand, do not need income continuously over the span of, let’s say, a year. Unlike workers, profits usually are determined periodically throughout the year. Capitalists understand this and set up their social lives around this reality. Consequently, capitalists have much greater bargaining power in this relationship; they are in a position to wait. There is also one critical external dependency that takes two forms. The first form is a relation to the broader economy. Capitalists are dependent upon markets to acquire the means of production that meet their technical requirements. They need to be able to find the materials, machines, locations, etc. that ensure their workers will be able to produce the desired output. Hence, a well-functiomng economy will create diverse and accessible markets that will provide affordable inputs into the production process. The second form is a relation to the broader society, particularly the health and education systems. Capitalists need workers that can do the job. They must be physically well enough to show up on a regular basis and perform the work. They also must have the knowledge, skills, and work expectations that the commodity requires in its production process. 2.3.0.3 Stage 3: Consumption The final stage of the circuit of capital is the sale and consumption of the Capitalist’s commodity to its consumer. This stage depends almost exclusively on the Capitalist and the Consumer. On the surface, the Capitalist has to produce a commodity that consumer will actually buy. She must also set it at a price consumers will be willing and able to pay. In this sense, Capitalists are quite dependent upon consumers desires and financial abilities. However, consumers rely heavily on Capitalists too. Consumers are simply workers by another name. If they are to be purchase the products they helped produce, they must first get paid enough by the Capitalist to do so. 2.3.1 Review Questions: How can each stage break down? What is the role of the State? How can/has/does the State alleviate the risks of economic crises in each stage?

In answering this question, we will need to address two related issues: money and taxes. This chapter will present students with a comprehensive view of the creation of profits at the macroeconomic level. In addition, it will provide students with an organized and detailed review of the Kalecki Profit Equation derived by Polish Economist Michael Kalecki (1969).8 After exploring the derivation of the Kalecki Profit Equation, the chapter turns to grounding our understanding of profits in the real word, through measurement. We will explore two measures of profits and integrate these measures into our unfolding framework of the macroeconomy. After reading this chapter, students will be able to: Answer the question: Where do profits come from? Describe the relationship between money creation and profits. Derive the Kalecki Profit Equation. Define a “profit mark-up” and how it relates to prices. Explain the logic behind the infamous phrase, “Capitalists get what they spend, workers spend what they get.” Articulate the role of the State within the Circuit and how it uses its regulatory powers and spending/tax powers (specifically the federal deficit) to support profit expectations. Discuss the implications of the Kalecki Profit Equation on the relationship between Capitalism and Income Inequality. 3.2 The Role of Profits in a Capitalist Economy Chapter 2 introduced students to our initial framework for a Capitalist economy. The framework guides our analysis of the economy and helps us ask important questions about the stages and actors in that framework. We described an economic system guided by profit expectations. This raises a logical follow-up question: Just where do these profits come from? This question, it turns out, has a straight-forward answer. But, it will be one that you have largely been trained not to like and/or not to see. Profits, in a Capitalist economy, necessarily take the form of money. Therefore, to truly understand where profits come from in the system, we first need to understand how money gets created AND who gets to do the creating. Here we go. At this point, we are going to modify our framework from Chapter 2. Recall our discussion of frameworks both in class and previously in this text. Frameworks are tools to focus our attention, to guide our analysis in a thoughtful way. However, frameworks come at a price: they make us forget about what we do not see.9 Frameworks help us ask relevant and often powerful questions about the elements of the system we have put in play, but it is damn near impossible for us to ask questions about actors/stages/processes in the world that are not a part of our framework. And so, in this chapter we begin the process that we will continue throughout this book: we build the framework up. Figure 3.1 below takes our framework from Chapter 2 and properly locates “the State” as a powerful and central actor to this story. This diagram illustrates what I expect to come as no surprise: the state, or the administrative actors of the country, are just as important to the functioning of any economic system as the Worker, the Capitalist, or the Banker. Figure 3.1: Placing the State in Capitalism 3.2.1 A Story of Money Creation 3.2.1.1 State Money At this point, we need to answer an important question: Where does that money in Stage 1 come from? In general, the money we use in our economy comes from two places: the State and banks. National governments - at least those that issue their own currency - create new money every time they spend (see the dashed line moving from the State to Stage 1 in Figure 3.1 above). Now, this is one of those places where I’m going to ask you to unlearn something:The Government spends first and taxes back later. Put more directly, The Government doesn’t need your tax dollars to spend its dollar. Read that again and sit with it for a second…. You know the logic of this statement already, and yet every fiber of your being is pushing back against this fact. Think it through and let logic and reason win. To paraphrase Matt Damon in The Martian, “Let’s logic the s#%* out of this”, The Government is the sole issuer of the U.S. dollar. No one else can produce the U.S. dollar (or they go to jail for a long time!) We are required to pay taxes in the U.S. dollar. To pay the taxes in the U.S. dollar, we first have to accumulate those dollars from the economy. This means, logically, the dollars must be in the economy first, before anyone can pay their taxes. Government spending happens first. Taxes happen later. It’s logic. Every time the Government buys goods or services from the economy, it creates new money and sends it to household bank accounts and business bank accounts all across the country. Once that money is spent on goods/services/wages, that money is then used to buy other stuff (paper, cars, child care, computers, etc.). And this process keeps going. That new injection of money from the Government just keeps getting used by people and business throughout the economy. At the end of the year, we then calculate our income tax returns and pay taxes with the U.S. dollars we have accumulated. So, if taxes aren’t necessary for the State to spend, why tax at all? There are a few important reasons10, but the core reason is to ensure that there is a demand for State’s currency. Think about it. The State wants us to do things for it. It wants roads, schools, fire fighters, buildings, etc. To get us to do those things it has two options: carrot or stick. The stick is the State’s police force. It can throw you in jail if you don’t do what it tells you to. But, force is hard to sustain. More importantly though, what is to keep the police force itself from turning on the state? The carrot. The State says, “You must pay a tax every year and you must pay it in my currency.” In doing this, the State ensures that we all (including the police forces) will try to go do things that earn U.S. dollars. Those things are things the State wants us to do. We do them; we get paid; and then we can pay our taxes. But wait! Taxes do more still! Taxes create the private sector. Yeah, that’s another one where every fiber of your being is trying to push back. But, again, let logic prevail. Recognize what happens when we, as individuals, all try to go earn U.S. dollars so that we can pay our tax. We all have a common tax requirement and we all have to pay those taxes in U.S. dollars. But, that doesn’t mean we all have to work directly for the Government to get those dollars. Assume for a moment that you are a great cook. You love cooking things for others. But, you currently work on a road construction crew. Well, instead of working directly for that crew you could open up a restaurant instead. That crew can take their U.S. dollars they earn from working for the State and come and spend that money with you in exchange for an awesome meal. The better your restaurant skills are, the more your culinary empire grows. Soon the teachers are spending their money with you, then the firefighters, police officers, bus drivers, etc. You are accumulating U.S. dollars but not from doing work explicitly for the government. And, with those dollars you can pay your tax. That’s a pretty incredible thing. Taxes both create demand for the State’s currency and it ensures that we all use that currency with each other! Now, this brings us closer to the answer on profits. But let’s explore this idea of the tax a bit further yet. Now that we understand what is happening with a tax, it makes sense to ask “how large is the tax”? Let’s look at the extremes: tax back 100% of the dollars spent into the economy by the State. Think about what that does. Everything you earn working for the State directly or indirectly with your restaurant is taxed back…well that would be really stupid by the State. That doesn’t leave anything left for people to use on their own. If the currency has no use beyond paying taxes (and not going to prison) then we all might as well revolt right now. Now, go to the other extreme. Assume the government doesn’t tax at all. Well, then that currency is effectively useless (good for burning and arts and crafts proejcts with the kids though!). So, clearly taxes must be somewhere in the middle. This is just strategy. Low taxes bring risks (too much of the currency in the system OR too few goods and services being produced for the State), but High taxes bring risks too (higher risk of citizen anger - unless you offset other costs in exchange for the high taxes, e.g. make college and/or health care free). There isn’t an “optimal” answer here, at least not in the real world. But, whatever you decide does have some implications for profit expectations and profit realization in the economy. Profits cannot exist in an economy without money. I know I just keep throwing these bombs at you, but again think it through. Profits happen when a private producer (you the restaurateur) accumulates State money in excess of the State money you originally advanced for the business. Out of those profits you pay your tax to the State. What remains then are your net profits. What happens if the State doesn’t leave much money in the system (i.e. higher income taxes)? Well, then there are fewer dollars left in the economy to be divided between the wages paid to workers and the profits that accrue to Capitalists. Therefore, there is a direct link between profits and Government spending. More spending means more profits, period. This will largely depend on the distribution of income though. If the wage share of output (\\[\\frac{W}{Y}\\]) is large, then the additional profits available from the additional State spending will be relatively small. However, if the wage share is low then the pool of profits will increase substantially with each new round of Government spending. This concept of the distribution of income will play a central role in this course; my hope is that this story starts to illustrate why. So, we have one part of the answer to our question: Where do profits come from? That first answer is: State money and the tax requirement. State money is spent into a system where we all go after the same currency. In that environment, profits can accrue to some individuals. Now, that’s only part of the answer though. The second part of the answer is that profits are created when Banks create money, so-called “Bank money”. And they do this every time they lend. Let’s walk through it. 3.2.1.2 Bank Money The second part of the money creation story comes from the financial sector: Bank money. Here again, you’re going to need to unlearn a few things about banks. Ready? Banks do not lend out of deposits. Your bank does not take the money in your savings account and lend it out. That is a myth. In fact, is has essentially never been the case for banks (whether they use the U.S. dollar, gold, or some other money thing). So what do banks do then? Let’s say you don’t have enough State dollars saved under your mattress to fund your restaurant. So, you go to a bank. You bring them your business plan and it looks great. They approve your loan for $100,000. To emphasize the point, the bank does not take $100,000 out of someone else’s deposit account. It simply adds $100,000 to your account AND then adds $100,000 to its ledger on the accounts receivable side (i.e. it tracks that you owe the bank $100k). Where did that money come from? Thin air. They just created the money through their keyboard. That’s it.11 At this point, the Bank has created money, which Abba Lerner defined as “What we use to buy things.” Now that your account is flush, you’ve successfully completed Stage 1! Good work! So you move on to stage 2. You start spending that money. And every time you spend that money you’re creating incomes for others (both in wages and profits). And that money stays in the system as a part of the “money supply”. It stays in the system until you start making loan payments. Every time you make a payment you are actually taking money out of the economy (i.e. paying off a loan is just like paying your tax bill). So, every time a bank creates a loan (which happens a lot!) new money is being injected into the economy. Unlike State money though, Bank money is temporary. Everything that is created is eventually destroyed when the loan is paid in full. State money, that isn’t taxed back, actually stays in the economy. Now we have the second part of our answer to the question, “Where do profits come from?” At its most basic level, profits are generated when money is created. New dollars are made available for use in the economy and as those dollars are spent, they create incomes for others - part of which goes to wages and the other part to profits. More specifically, the two sources of profits are Government Expenditure by the State and Loans by banks. Figure 3.2 below illustrates both expenditure items and includes Corporate profits before taxes. Take a look at it. Which series does corporate profits seem to move with the most? Why is the corporate profits line less than both the Government Expenditures and Bank Loans and Leases?12 Figure 3.2: Placing the State in Capitalism There you have it. Profits are created when new money is spent into the economy AND is left in the economy at least temporarily. That’s the simple answer. But, this answer just tells us where it comes from, it doesn’t help us understand the factors that determine the level of profits in the economy. For that, we turn to the Kalecki Profit Equation. 3.3 The Place of the Profit Equation The Kalecki Profit Equation plays a critical role in our understanding of Capitalism. The Kalecki Profit Equation essentially formalizes Marx’s Circuit of Capital. It answers a critical question too: What determines the level of profits at the macro-level? The answer to this question also has an important implication for the order of things. I want to highlight that here: the equation determines the level of profits at the macroeconomic level. It does not determine the profit-level of a business or sector. Instead, it suggests the level of profits that Capitalists are competing for. And make no mistake, Capitalists do compete against each other, fiercely so. And that’s a great thing for all of us.13 3.3.1 The original two-sector model Here, I’m going to derive our first real mathematical model, an equation. I will go slowly through this, but it is up to you to go over this several times to ensure you both know the profit equation AND how it was derived. Again, take it slow but be dilligent. First, we will do it as Kalecki did: we will ignore the rest of the world and the government. The second time around I’ll add the government back in (on both sides). Let’s start with the two-sector model with just households that consume (\\(C\\)) and businesses that invest (\\(I\\)).The Profit Equation begins with the GDP accounting identity that says total incomes must equal total spending. Total spending occurs through the consumption (\\(C\\)) and Investment (\\(I\\)) variables. But, total incomes are different. For now, as Kalecki did, we will assume a society made up of workers who earn wages (\\(W\\)) and Capitalists who earn profits (\\(\\pi\\)). Equation 1 below illustrates the identity. \\[\\begin{equation} Wages (W) + Profits (\\pi) = Consumption (C) + Investment (I) \\end{equation}\\] Kalecki then divides consumption into its sources of income: \\(C = C_w + C_{\\pi}\\), where \\(C_w\\) is “consumption out of wages” and \\(C_{\\pi}\\) is “consumption out of profits”. Substitute this into Equation 1. \\[\\begin{equation} W + \\pi = C_w + C_{\\pi} + I \\end{equation}\\] Next, subtract \\(C_w\\) from both sides. \\[\\begin{equation} W - C_w + \\pi = C_{\\pi} + I \\end{equation}\\] Now the right-hand side of the equation only consists of Capitalist spending out of their own profits and Capitalists spending through the businesses they own. The left-hand side of the equation consistes of the wages workers earn less their spending out of wages, plus Capitalist profits. We can clarify then that \\(W - C_w = S_w\\), or “savings out of wages”. Substitute that into Equation 3 below. \\[\\begin{equation} S_w + \\pi = C_{\\pi} + I \\end{equation}\\] Finally, let’s get profits by itself on the left-hand side. Kalecki’s original profit equation is now complete: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi = C_{\\pi} + I - S_w \\end{equation}\\] Equation 5 provides the answer to the question posed above: What determines the level of profits across the economy as a whole? Equation 5 also highlights a fundamental truth about the inherent incentives in a Capitalist economy. Recall that savings out of wages (\\(S_w = W - C_w\\)). If we plug this back into Equation 6, we see that worker’s own spending actually adds to Capitalist profits in that period. The wages paid out to workers is the real problem for profit acccumulation. As workers are paid more, on average, their wages absorb what would otherwise be accumulated profits. However, it is possible that the level of wages and the level of profits could still increase, due to a sizeable increase in investment. But, if we divide both sides of Equation 6 by GDP (\\(Y\\)), we can see what the Kalecki Profit Equation can tell us about the distribution of income between profit’s share of output (\\(\\frac{\\pi}{Y}\\)) and labor’s share of output (\\(\\frac{W}{Y}\\)). \\begin(equation) = + - \\end{equation} Equation 14 presents the true recipie of the Capitalist system. Though it is possible for the levels of wages and profits to both rise, it is not possible for labor’s share of income to rise and profit’s share of income to rise simultaneously. They are negatively related. Any gains by workers, will necessarily come at the expense of Capitalists. This has serious implications for a system that we are all “bought into” to some extent. We all depend on this process working. Therefore, the strongest incentives in the system are to support an increasing share of income for Capitalists at the expense of the Worker’s share of income. It’s quite literally, “backed into the cake”. 3.3.2 Implications of the two-sector model Kalecki argues that total profits are determined by Capitalist’s own spending out of their previously accumulated profits and Capitalist’s own spending through the businesses they own via investment. The Equation also highlights the relationship between profits and wages. As workers save more, this necessarily reduces the level of profits14 Recall that \\(S_w = W - C_w\\). So, from the Capitalist perspective your goal is to minimize worker savings. There are two ways to do that. First, you can keep wages low. Or, taking the approach attributed to Henry Ford, you can increase worker consumption out of the wages they are paid. Nicholas Kaldor summed up Kalecki’s findings in the effective phrase: “Capitalists get what they spend; workers spend what they get.” 3.3.3 The multi-sector model Now, let’s make this a bit more relevant by bringing the government into the fold, along with the financial sector, property owners, and the rest of the world. \\[\\begin{equation} Wages (W) + Profits (\\pi) + Interest (i) + Rent (r) + Taxes (T) = Consumption (C) + Investment (I) + Government Spending (G) + Exports (X) - Imports (M) \\end{equation}\\] Reproduce the same steps as before. Break consumption into two classes. Solve for worker savings and then solve for profits. After doing so, you should get the following: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi = \\underbrace{C_{\\pi} + I + G + X}_{\\text{Gross Profits}} - \\underbrace{M - i - r - T - S_w}_{\\text{Expenses out of Gross Profits}} \\end{equation}\\] Equation 7 identifies the sources of profit generation in the economy and the expenses that are paid out of gross profits. This is useful, but we can rearrange this a bit to clarify some relationships. \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi = C_{\\pi} + I + (G - T) + (X - M) - i - r - S_w \\end{equation}\\] Equation 8 arranges the variables in more useful terms. Let’s unpack this equation a bit. \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi = \\underbrace{C_{\\pi} + I}_{\\text{Capitalist&#39;s own spending}} + \\underbrace{(G - T)}_{\\text{the government deficit}} + \\underbrace{(X - M)}_{\\text{the rest of the world}} - \\underbrace{i - r}_{\\text{financial and capital markets}} - \\underbrace{S_w}_{\\text{labor markets}} \\end{equation}\\] 3.3.4 Implications of the multi-sector model In looking at Equation 9, we can see the individual pieces to the story of profits at the macro level. The original finding still holds. One of the major sources of Capitalist profits are Capitalists themselves. But we also have two additional sources of profits: the domestic public sector’s deficit spending and the rest of the world (but only if \\(X &gt; M\\)). The rest of the factors detract from profits, including interest paid to the financial sector, rents paid to property owners, and as before, worker savings out of wages. In the U.S. context, and much of the developed world, net exports (X - M) is actually negative, meaning they import more than they export. So, in reality, the primary sources of net profits at the macro level are Capitalists themselves - through their own spending out of past profits and the spending of the firms they own - and the domestic public sector’s deficit. 3.4 How do Capitalists get what they spend? Let’s talk for a moment about how this works. Here, I’m going to introduce the notion of a profit markup on costs (\\(\\mu\\)). Most prices in the economy are set by adding a profit markup on top of costs.15 So, every time you buy a pop, a pizza, a notebook, etc. the prices you are paying include a profit markup, \\(\\mu\\).16 With this understanding, we can now see how Capitalist household spending adds to profits. Everything they purchase contains a profit markup. The same is true of business investment. When firms invest, they buy goods and services from other firms, at prices set by those other firms - prices that include their profit markups. When the public sector spends, they do so directly to workers (who then go buy products at prices that include markups) or contract directly with firms at prices that include profit markups. In short, nearly all spending generates profits somewhere in the system. 3.5 Profits and Deficits This chapter has outlined the role of State spending and bank lending in creating the potential scale of profits at the macroeconomic level. The four sources of profit creation are Capitalists own spending on consumption goods, Workers own spending on consumption goods, Capitalists own spending on Investment goods, and the State’s deficit spending - the money it spends into the economy but does not tax back. We will turn to investment spending in Chapter 6. Here though, I want to explore the State’s deficit spending in more detail using the Sectoral Balances Equation pioneered by the British Economist Wynne Godley. We can derive the Sectoral Balances Equation from the Kalecki Profit Equation itself. Beginning with Equation 9, we can move all of the domestic private sector incomes and spending to the left-hand side of the equals sign. The result is a simple but powerful accounting identity: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi + i + r) -C_{\\pi} + S_w - I = (G - T) + (X - M) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\underbrace{S_{\\pi} + S_w - I}_\\text{Domestic Private Savings} = \\underbrace{(G - T)}_\\text{Public Sector Deficit} + \\underbrace{(X - M)}_\\text{Trade Deficit} \\end{equation}\\] Equation 13 lays it all out there. The left-hand side of the equation represents “Net Financial Assets” of the “Domestic Private Sector”. In other words, it indicates how much the savings accounts of individuals in the U.S. domestic private sector have grown in a given period. But, these net financial assets must come from somewhere, and equation 13 articulates those potential sources of wealth accumulation: the domestic public sector deficit (\\(G &gt; T\\)) OR a trade surplus (\\(X &gt; M\\)). In the case of the US, this reveals an uncomfortable truth for many, but it is a truth nonetheless. We have a structural trade deficit (\\(X &lt; M\\)). That means the only way our domestic private sector can accumulate net financial assets (i.e. can accumulate wealth) is if the US Government engages in deficit spending at a rate that exceeds the leakage from our trade deficit! In other words, the US Government’s deficit must be larger than the US Trade Deficit…all the time! Here again, your mind wants to say, “that can’t be right”. Well, look for yourself: Figure 3.3 illustrates Equation 13 in action. I’ve excluded the trade deficit from this visual to illustrate the connection between the domestic public sector and the domestic private sector. Figure 3.3: US Sectoral Balances (1960 - 2022) We see the exact relationship we would expect, given the structural trade deficit. The US Government is essentially always in a deficit position. You’ve been trained to believe that’s bad. But, as Dr. Stephanie Kelton likes to point out, “One sector’s deficit is another person’s surplus!” The Government deficit is our surplus. It’s the money left in the economy that isn’t taxed back. And, as the Kalecki Profit Equation shows us, it’s a primary source of net profits in the economy. What happens if the State does not engage in deficit spending? Well, we have an example right there in Figure 3.3 but before we walk through that, let’s see if we can guess. Our exploration of the structure of the US economy suggests that profits and profit expectations are critical to the operation of the Circuit of Capital. If public sector deficits aren’t large enough to offset the trade deficit, this would result in a net loss of net financial assets in the domestic private sector. Recall, that sector combines for about 85% of GDP. So, if we start sucking resources out of that spending that will hurt sales of final goods and services in the economy (both in consumption and in investment). In other words, it will cause an economic downturn. Well, that’s exactly what happened in from 1998 through 2001 and then again from 2004 through 2007. In both cases, the US public defict was either too small or actually in surplus! As the economy lost out on State money, it moved to replace it with bank money (go look at Figure 3.2 again). But, households and firms can only take on so much debt before the house of cards comes tumbling down. At tumble it did. The takeaway here is simple, though strongly counter to conventional wisdom: State deficits aren’t just good for profits, they are critical to the health of the economy. 3.6 Conclusion a Jerome Levy is credited with uncovering this equation some 30 years years before Kalecki.
