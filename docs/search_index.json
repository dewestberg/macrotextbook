Westberg 2022-08-28 Preface 0.1 What is this? This is the textbook for Prof. Westberg’s Introduction to Macroeconomics course. It is a book for college students, not for college profs. This book will be published as an open-source text when it is complete. It is ultimately intended to help my students learn how the economy works, how that affects their lives, and what they can do about it. I’ll cut to the quick: the Economy does what it is designed to do. Many of my economic colleagues would disagree with that statement, but look at the structure of unemployment by race, age, gender, and class over the past 18 years of your lives and ask a simple question: Why doesn’t this ever change? It isn’t because there is something inherently different in the productivity of these groups. Rather, it’s grounded in the different ways that these groups are perceived in economic (and social-political) situations. In other words, these groups are treated differently by the economy because the people who ultimately wrote and are rewriting the economic rules see those groups differently. Whether they realize it or not, the rule writers almost always write rules to benefit their own groups.1 We live in highly politicized times. I have no doubt that many of you reading this have already formed some idea of what is in this book, and this class, from the preceding paragraph. Let me, perhaps, surprise you: whether you think this book will fit into some lefty-liberal agenda or some right-wing populist revolt, you’d be right. This book is political. All books are. But, the approach I will teach you forces all of us to engage our core beliefs, to interrogate them, and to be willing to find them lacking. What if your most cherished political belief turns out to be useless at best (i.e. “free markets”) or just flat out wrong at worst (i.e. “banks lend out of deposits”)? Well, in this class, you’ll learn to accept it and move on. My only ask of you this: recognize you come to this class with your own ideology, beliefs, and expectations - we all do, including me! - but be willing to take these on. Be skeptical but learn to be logical. This book is intended to give you to the tools to understand how the economy is designed to work, what drives it, and how that shapes the world we live in. My sincere hope is that you are one day able to use it to reshape the economy to produce the kind of outcomes that you want to see in the world your generation constructs. I believe it is possible; I hope you do to. 0.2 Who am I? I have been teaching Principles of Macroeconomics for nearly a decade now. I’ve taught the course over 30 times to nearly 1,000 students. In that time, I have moved farther and farther away from standard Macroeconomics textbooks, pushing my course content to more aptly reflect the pressing questions of today’s students: climate change, income inequality, racial justice, power, and money (interest in that one never seems to go away :) ). That move has been a success both in terms of student achievement and student satisfaction. In fact, in 2021 I was honored to receive the Charles J. Lynch Outstanding Teacher Award at Coe College. I say this to give you confidence in what I am teaching you. Whether you’re a Democrat, a Republican, or something else entirely, the economy still shapes your life and I’m here to show you how that happens. This book is about teaching and learning. It is meant to be accessible, not another barrier to learning challenging content. I will supplement it with recorded lectures, PowerPoint slides, and in-class discussions. But, the essentials of the content will be here. If you love math, there are chapters for you here. If you hate math but love story, there are chapters here for you too. And I promise to do my best to help both camps get through their respective fears. I am also a father of two young, amazing humans: June and Michael. This book is as much for them as it is for you. I want them to live in a better world, a more just world, a sustainable world, and a world grounded in Democracy and equality of opportunity. They will live in the world you and I create…so the pressure, so to speak, is on. 0.3 Why this book? There are two reasons for this book. First and foremost, it is for you. Part of my movement away from textbooks was the cost to students. It was pretty wild to ask students to pay hundreds for a textbook that didn’t speak to them. It was a little better to just use old versions of those books to save money. But, those books have grown increasingly out of date and out of touch too. As I have continued to move away from textbooks in my class, it has made it more challenging for some students to stay connected to the material. Though PowerPoints can help, students need more and varied points of connection to both learn concepts and put them into practice. To that end, I have written this book for you (and it’s free!). Second, the standard macroeconomics textbook has grown increasingly vapid over time. College students today face a world of myriad crises: inequality, debt, guns, pandemics, declining psychological health, growing social dysfunction, and oh yeah, the planet is on @#*%&amp;@# fire (FYI the following link does contain explicit language from Bill Nye the Science Guy). Yet, the current stock of macroeconomics textbooks won’t teach you how to incorporate income distribution into the foundation of your analysis; they won’t show you how the economy interacts with the environment; and they certainly won’t help you understand the political economy of power. And so, my second purpose for this book is write a book that actually addresses some of the very real and daunting challenges that lie ahead for us: you, me, my children, and yours. This is a book about The Economy &amp; Us. 0.4 My Approach My approach to the economy and to teaching has been shaped by many economists across a wide range of so-called schools of thought. As a theorist though, I find myself coming back to the work of Elinor (“Lin”) Ostrom, the first woman to win the coveted Nobel Prize in Economics.2 Though her award focused on her main academic conclusion - “complexity is not the same as chaos” - it is her approach to theory construction that has always stood out to me. Specifically, Prof. Ostrom argues that theory construction should rest on a specific architecture: a framework, a set of theories, and models that illustrate those theoretical connections. As noted by one of Ostrom’s former colleagues, Michael McGinnis (2011) a, Framework identifies, categorizes, and organizes those factors deemed most relevant to understanding some phenomenon. Theory posits general causal relationships among some subsets of these variables or categories of factors, designating some types of factors as especially important and others as less critical for explanatory purposes. Model specifies the specific functional relationships among particular variables or indicators that are hypothesized to operate in some well-defined set of conditions. We will rely on this architecture to structure the book and our examination of the various theoretical perspectives on “the economy”. In doing so, my hope is that you will be better able to think critically about the economic answers that dominate our personal media environments. 0.5 Structure of the Book The book will adhere to Ostrom’s architecture. First, we will lay out the framework and attempt to fully understand its varied components, its data, and its definitions. Then we will move into the theory and modelling stages. In Part I, we will spend some time learning to talk about what the economy is and what it does. Then, we will move to construct a framework of the economy. Initially, this framework will be quite incomplete. However, we will add to it as we move through the material, learning along the way just how important a framework is to problem solving and thinking through complexity.3 With a framework of the macroeconomy in place, Part II of the book will move us into Classical Economic Theory, i.e. the set of causal relationships between the variables in our framework that were adhered to (believed in?) by so-called “Classical Economists”. This theoretical approach dominated economic theorizing for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Once we understand the core Classical Theoretical beliefs, we will move to construct the Classical Model, which is an analytical tool that illustrates the Classical Theory in action. We will use this model to illustrate how economists think. We will explain the past, examine the present, and predict the future. The Classical Theory was a useful explanation of the economy for its time. But, as is typical in human history, this view of the world eventually stopped being able to explain it effectively. The Great Depression presented something that did not exist within Classical Theory - prolonged involuntary unemployment. Thankfully, a small cohort of economists in Britain had been slowly tearing themselves apart from this outdated view in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Three names in particular are worth mentioning here: Keynes, Kalecki, and Robinson. These economists helped shape and ultimately export what came to be known as “Keynesian Economics”, the subject of Part III of the course, to the rest of the world. Here, we will explore the emergence of a new set of theoretical propositions that came to be known as Keynesian Theory. This approach to the economy was quite different from Classical Theory. In almost every way, the Keynesian approach turned the Classical Theory upside down (or perhaps better described as “right-side up”). This new theory became dominant in most economic circles from the late 1930s into the late 1960s. From there, the theoretical paths diverged rather dramatically. Most economics textbooks take students down a path that frankly doesn’t yield much fruit - and that’s putting it rather kindly. Instead, this book will diverge at that point and move students’ thinking toward more relevant questions of this age, using more comprehensive tools and more empirically validated theories. With these tools in place, we will explore big questions: What is the impact of income inequality on the economy? How can the economy and the environment be connected? Is there a connection between inequality writ large and the environmental catastrophe we are all living in the midst of already? My hope is that you, the student, will find this material engaging, accessible, but most importantly, relevant. It will not be an easy journey, but deep learning never is. 0.6 The Importance of Goals At this point, I’m going to ask you to read the Introduction and Ch. 1 The Gross Domestic Product out of an incredibly important book, What’s the Economy For Anyway?. The book asks a central question. The answer is for all of us to determine together and that is the power behind simply asking the question. It presumes that there can be an actual answer. The economy therefore is something we can shape, alter, re-orient. For most students and most adults quite frankly, this revelation is hard to fathom. In my experience, most students sense the economy as something like gravity, an external force that is shaping their lives but something far beyond their ability to influence. They just hope to hitch a good ride. The first chapter in that book shows you just how wrong that assumption is; it also helps you start to see how much it benefits political and economic elites when we succumb to this common belief. Once you see that in fact we can make substantive changes, my hope is that you will never “unsee it” again. Let’s look at some outcomes, economic outcomes. I want you to take a few minutes and go to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s aptly named data center, FRED and attempt to plot the following data series: Gross Domestic Output Unemployment Rate We will dive into these measures in more detail in the next chapter. For now, I want you to look carefully at these two major measures that we use to manage the economy. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the overall size of the economy. The Unemployment Rate tells you the percent (%) of all job seekers that aren’t able to find work. These measures, coupled with inflation (again we will dive into that one shortly), give us the big three measures that Macroeconomists use to assess the overall health of the economy. If GDP is bigger than last month/quarter/year, if inflation is right around 2%, and if the Unemployment Rate is around 5%, most Macroeconomists would tell the economy is at Full Employment. Technically, they would tell you that the economy has reached its “Non-accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment”, or put simply, there are enough unemployed people to keep prices from rising too fast. But, let me ask you a question: What is it that we are trying to achieve with an economic system managed around the idea of raising GDP and keeping prices low through a buffer of unemployed people? That’s the big question: what is the goal? These measures of the economy are just measures. They are just indicators that the economy is doing what we have designed it to do. They are a means to some end. But what are the ends of the economy? What do we want it to do? At this point, I’ve already put you in a mental box. Let me show you how. Quickly now, I want you to make a list of the five things you want the economy to do. Do it. Go fast. Now: I’ll bet that most, if not all of you put something about growth, unemployment, and inflation on your lists. You’ve confused economic measures with economic goals. It’s okay. You’ve been trained to do that. Now, let’s undue some of that training. Step outside of the economy for a moment and do a different thought exercise with me. I want you to establish five goals for your life by answering this question: What are the five most important things you need to live a happy, healthy, and flourishing human life? Take your time this time. Think it through, carefully (I’ll share my five things with you in class). Now, how many of you wrote something like “Make the economy bigger”? I doubt any of you did and that’s the point. The things that matter to you as human beings are much deaper things. Things that revolve around community connection, doing meaningful work, meeting new people and experiencing new places, etc. There is so much that goes into a flourishing human life, and frankly, not nearly enough of those things show up in our measures of the economy. GDP, unemployment, inflation, these are just measures, sign-posts that help us know if we are heading toward our goal(s) or if we are off track. Which brings us to the question of the day: based on the big three measures of the economy, can you tell me what the economic goal(s) is(are)? And, just who’s goals are they? For readers who really want to dive into this right away, I urge you to download Chelwa, Hamilton, and Stewarts latest work on Stratification Economics.↩︎ I encourage you to listen to her 2009 speech here.↩︎ For those of you with little patience, the key takeaway is that our frameworks define what questions can be asked. For example, if the environment does not exist in your framework, then how important are you likely to think it is in effecting your problem of concern? Simply put, you would never even think to ask!↩︎ "],["measuring-the-economy-means-as-ends-or-means-to-ends.html", "Chapter 1 Measuring the Economy: Means as Ends or Means to Ends? 1.1 Purpose &amp; Learning Objectives 1.2 Just how big is it? 1.3 Conclusion", " Chapter 1 Measuring the Economy: Means as Ends or Means to Ends? 1.1 Purpose &amp; Learning Objectives The purpose of this chapter is to ground our collective ability to describe the economy through a number of important measures, or standards of judgement, that we seem to think are useful indicators that the economy is doing what we want it to do. After reading this chapter, students will be able to: Define Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Articulate the formula for GDP and the relative contributions of each component of GDP to its total value. Critique GDP as a measure and define the Human Development Index (HDI). Describe the difference between a data series that is a “level” vs a “rate”. 1.2 Just how big is it? The first task in any serious examination of a subject is to define the unit of analysis. Here in Macroeconomics, we are analyzing the economy as a whole - what it does, how it works, and how healthy it is. Our starting point for this introduction is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is the main measure of economic activity in the world. We use it to answer a set of specific questions: How big is the economy? Is the economy growing, shrinking, or stable? What sectors are the most important to the economy? 1.2.1 Defining GDP First, let’s define this measure and then we will set out to answer these three questions. GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced domestically in a given year. You’ll want to commit that definition to memory. We will come back to it often and you will be tested on it, often. This definition rests on three important terms: market value, final goods and services, and domestically. “Market value”, in economics, is simply the price buyers actually pay for a good or service times the quantity they buy. If you bought 5 cups of coffee this morning at $3.00 a cup, the “market value” of that purchase was $15.00. If a buyer purchased a 100 bushels of wheat to produce some flour at $9.91 a bushel, the market value of that purchase was $991.00. Both of these transactions have a value in the market…BUT, only one of those counts toward GDP - the coffee of course!. Here’s why. GDP relies on the notion of a final good or service. These are goods and services that are purchased to be consumed/used, not to become part of another production process. This latter type of good is called an intermediate good - it is purchased to incorporate into the production process of a final good. For example, rubber is purchased to produce tires. Tires are produced for a new car/truck. The final good here is the car/truck, not the rubber.4 Finally, GDP is constructed on the idea of domestic production. It is a measure of the economic activity happening within a country’s political borders. Businesses from countries from all of the world produce in the United States. All of the final goods produced and sold by those plants and factories operating here in the US count toward the United States’ GDP. The size of their contribution is the market value of their final sales. 1.2.2 Measuring GDP Now that we have some initial clarity on the definition of GDP, let’s see it in action. The agency responsible for measuring and reporting out U.S. GDP is called the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Go there now and try to find the data for GDP.5 In general, just look around for a minute and see just a snapshot of what’s there. We will use Bureau of Economic Analysis a fair bit in the coming weeks. For now, let’s keep practicing with the St. Louis FRED website. Using the search tool, go find the data series for “Gross Domestic Product”. When you do, you should be able to reproduce Figure 1 below. Figure 1.1: US GDP (1947-2021 Let’s explore Figure 1 for a moment. Before you look to closely at the line graph, I want you to look at the X and Y axes. Go slowly here, there’s no rush. Make sure you know what the axes are AND what units they are in. The X-axis is pretty clear: it’s just the year with labels only showing up in 5-year intervals. The Y-axis though might be intimidating for you. If it is, don’t worry and just trust me. Go slowly. There is no rush. The Y-axis is “Billions of Dollars”. That is telling you how many zeros to add to any number that shows up on the Y-axis. For example, if the Y-axis said “Thousands of Dollars”, then any number on the Y-axis would need three zeros added to it - because 1,000 has three zeros. So, $100 becomes $100,000; $1,000 becomes $1,000,000; and $20,000 becomes $20,000,000. We know that one Billion Dollars has nine zeros: $1,000,000,000. So, we need to add nine zeros to any number on the Y-axis. That means that $24,000 Billion Dollars is really $24,000,000,000,000. That’s $24 Trillion dollars … and there you have it, you’ve answered the first question on our list. The U.S. economy is a $24 Trillion dollar economy. That’s how big it is. The second question is also something we can find out with this data series in FRED. When we want to find out if something is growing or not, we calculate its percent change (i.e. its rate of growth) from the levels of its data series. Figure 1 is Gross Domestic Product in levels. It tells us the level of water ($24 Trillion) in the bucket that is the US economy. To calculate a percent change (how much water was added to or drained from the bucket), just use this formula: \\[\\begin{equation} \\%\\Delta = \\frac{New - Old}{Old} * 100 \\end{equation}\\] Equation 1 says that the percent change (signified by the Greek symbol \\(\\Delta\\) - read it as “Delta”) is equal to the newest level value minus the older level value of interest, divided by the older level value of interest. That will give you a basic proportion. Multiplying it by 100 then puts the percent value (aka the rate) in terms we are used to seeing, e.g. 5%. Let’s do one quick example by answering the question: How much did the economy grow (i.e. what rate did GDP grow by) from 2020 to 2021? First, find the level value of GDP for 2021: $22.996 Trillion. Second, find the level value of GDP for 2020: $20.893 Trillion. Now, just use the formula to “plug n chug”. And now we have answered the second question. The economy grew over 6.7% in 2021. Now, on your own, convert the GDP data series in FRED to “percent change”. You should have been able to replicate Figure 2, below. If not, you need to try a few more times but then ask for help. Figure 1.2: US GDP Growth Rates, 1947-2021 Figure 2 tells you the story of growth in the US Economy from 1947, just two years after the conclusion to World War II. The graph really shows a story of two periods of growth. From essentially 1950 - 1978, we see that the growth rate in the economy was increasing (imagine a thick red line that cuts through the middle of the line graph). But, notice from 1978 to 2021 the underlying trend is downward sloping (still positive growth, but increasingly slower growth). This break will be an important one as we examine income inequality in more detail below. For now, just focus on being able to “see” that underlying trendline in your mind’s eye. Figures 1 and 2 give us our first direct comparison between levels and rates. Figure 1 is relatively smooth, with seemingly small movements from one period to the next. Figure 2 though is much more volatile, meaning the movements from one period to the next look large. It definitely is not a smooth line. Now it’s time to answer our third question. Which industries seem to drive GDP in the United States. For that, we need to go to the BEA. Here, we are going to explore “Value Added by Industry” from 2019 through 2021.6 You’ll need to play with this a bit to learn how to use the website effectively. Take that experience seriously. Table 1 below provides a breakdown of GDP (i.e. the total market value of all final goods and services produced domestically - by firms in these industries - in the years of 2019, 2020, and 2021) according to the major industry group classifications. We can use this information to answer our third question that we can use GDP to answer: What industries are driving change in the US economy? Figure 1.3: Industrial Drivers of US GDP When you look at Table 1, look from the top down and pay particular attention to the indents. Notice that “Mining” is below “Private Industries” and indented. That means that “Mining” is a sub-component of “Private Industries”. In other words, you do not compare these two groups. Rather, mining is a piece of the total GDP from Private Industries. But, you can compare “Mining” and “Utilities”. Why? Because they are left-indented to the same extent. Now, using this information look down the list of industries that are contributing to GDP. Which ones seem to matter most? The four industries that contribute the most to GDP are: Finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing, Professional and business services, Government, and Manufacturing I’ve made this list by relying on the levels of their individual contributions to GDP. Look at Table 1 again. Manufacturing produced roughly $2.37 Trillion in final sales in 2019. Now, that’s a big number. And, frankly, it’s a number that means basically nothing to any normal human. So, let’s transform it to something that makes mroe sense: ** a proportion**. To do that, we simply divide the level (i.e. $2.37) by the total economy ($21,373). This ratio is simply asking how big is the total contribution of manufacturing to the US economy? The answer: In 2019, Manufacturing made up just over 11% of the US economy. Take a second and consider what that means to you? Does that seem high? Low? Again, it’s just not that meaningful unless you have something to compare it to. What if I told you that manufacturing’s typical share of GDP for a mid- to large-sized city would be about 20%, what do you think about that 11% figure? Well, okay, that’s not a comparison to a federal government though. So, let’s make a better comparison. Let’s look at manufacturing’s share of GDP in the US over time. Figure 1.4: US Manufacturing as a share of GDP, 1997 - 2021 Figure 3 tells us quite a few things about manufacturing’s relationship with the US economy. First, we see that manufacturing’s share of GDP has been declining steadily since 1997. It certainly still matters to the overall level of total US output, but it’s becoming less important over time. Second, the rate of decline in manufacturing’s share of GDP is decreasing BUT it is decreasing slower in more recent years. If we extend that curve out (again in your mind’s eye), manufacturing’s share of GDP is approaching a resting place at approximately 10% of GDP. There you have it. We’ve answered our three questions. The US economy is a $24 Trillion economy. It grew at 6.7% from 2020 to 2021. And, the economy is driven by four large industrial sectors (some of which are becoming less important like Manufacturing, while others are becoming much more important like Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate.). 1.2.3 How is this measure constructed? The GDP Identity Now that we’ve been able to use the definition of GDP and some data from the BEA to describe the economy, let’s dive into the structure of GDP. In other words, how do they actually come up with these numbers? One of the most important equations in this class is the equation for GDP. Equation 2 is what we call an Accounting Identity, which is an equation that is true by definition. It tells us how total spending on final goods and services are broken down by their primary actor. \\[\\begin{equation} Y = C + I + G + X - M \\end{equation}\\] Equation 2 tells us that total GDP (“Y”) can be broken down into six components: Household Consumption (C) Business Investment (I) Government Expenditure (G) Total Exports (X) Total Imports (M) These components are not equally important in size, nor in theory. Figure 4 illustrates the relative shares of GDP and their trends over time. Figure 1.5: Spending components of US GDP, 1947 - 2021 Household consumption is the total spending on domestically-produced final goods and services by households - by you and me - in a given year. According to Figure 4, our collective spending accounts for nearly 70% of total GDP. Our spending accounts for almost 70% of $24 Trillion…wow, we spend a lot. Notice too, that the share of GDP attributable to household consumption grew considerably from the mid-1950s through 2000. Since 2000, the relative share of GDP has remained essentially unchanged. Business investment is the total spending on domestically-produced final goods and services by firms in a given year. In Figure 4, we see that Business Investment has historically been pretty consistent, between 15% - 21% of GDP each year. This structural relationship has largely been the same since the mid-1990s. Government expenditure is the total spending on domestically-produced final goods and services by state, local, and federal government agencies in the US, in a given year. It’s important to note too, that more than 68% of total Government spending comes from State and Local governments (much of which does come from federal government transfers). Figure 4 shows us a different trend from the previous two lines of interest. Government’s share of GDP has actually been consistently getting smaller since, essentially, 1970. From essentially the 1950s through 1970, total Government spending hovered around 23%. In 2021, that share had fallen to just 17.2%. Total exports represents the final purchases of domestically-produced goods and services that are purchased from outside of US political borders. Canada and Mexico are our largest trade partners, buying largely refined and crude petrolium products. Total exports remained largely stable at around 10% from 1980 into 2010. Following the Great Recession, US exports grew somewhat but largely returned to its 10% level by 2020. Total imports are somewhat different. This data series represents the total domestic purchases of final goods and services not produced domestically in a given year. In other words, how much money people in US jurisdictions send abroad for goods and services. Figure 4 indicates a consistently growing share of imports since the mid-1970s. In 2020, the US purchased over $144 Billion in cars from China, our primary source of imports. We will explore trade relationships in more detail in the coming chapters. For now, I’d encourage you to explore the picture of US exports and imports here. 1.2.4 GDP, HDI, and Inequality So far, we’ve done a solid job of wrapping our heads around the idea of measuring the economy, particularly through Gross Domestic Product. Now, we turn our attention toward a bigger question: Just what does GDP measure? And, how does that align with our (your!) goals? Let’s walk through it. 1.2.4.1 GDP Definitions really do matter. Think about that definition of GDP: the total market value of all final goods and services produced domestically within a given year. What all counts? Well, it turns out, lots of things that are good (money spent on travel, on our health, on our schools) but also lots of things that don’t. But, as Economist John de Graaf says, “Maybe Bobby Kennedy said it best.” Take a listen [here]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FAmr1la6w0). The story of GDP is one worth reading about. That’s why every student that goes through my Principles of Macroeconomics course has to read it. It shows us the importance of measuring what matters. When the measure no longer measures what we care about, it’s time for a new one. That’s how we got to GDP in the first place. Though it isn’t nearly the dominant force that GDP is, a new measure, the Human Development Index aims to counter some of the shortcomings of GDP.7 1.2.4.2 HDI The Human Development Index takes GDP per person (often called “GDP per capita” or “Gross National Income”), avg. lifetime expectancy at birth, and the mean years of schooling for each country. Check out where your country stands on the HDI here. The good people at MeasureofAmerica.org have taken it upon themselves to apply the HDI formula to US states. You can see their rankings as of 2013-2014 on Google Classroom. Take a break from reading now and go check it out. What do you see? How well is this measure doing at articulating how “well” humans are living in US states? HDI, as it turns out, really isn’t as good of a measure of human well-being as we can get. Rather, according to economists and psychologists who study things like happiness and stress, the primary measure of human well-being is income inequality. Take a moment and watch this thought provoking Ted Talk by Epidemiologist Richard Wilkinson. 1.2.4.3 Inequality According to Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, income inequality is deeply connected to social dysfunction. More unequal societies trust less, have more mental illness, and are generally much worse on a variety of “good” things than more equal societies. One of the best places to explore income inequality across the globe is through the OECD. If we are persuaded by Wilkinson, Pickett, and Oishi et al.’s theses, then income inequality must be a central measure to how we view the economy. 1.3 Conclusion In this chapter, we have explored how we measure the size of the economy: Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We can define it. We can measure it. We can visualize it. We can use it to describe how big an economy is, whether that economy is growing or shrinking, and we can use it to understand what kinds of work are driving that economy’s performance. In short, we can say quite a lot about an economy through the measure of GDP. However, we also know that GDP is not everything. In fact, it is just a measure of scale. It says very little about the things that make individual human lives “worth living”, to borrow from Bobby Kennedy. It also can go up for quite bad reasons like, natural disasters, violence, illness, or medical accidents. Just as GNP trasnformed to GDP at one point, some are trying to move us away from GDP toward something like the Human Development Index (HDI). Still, other measures matter too. Are people that want to work able to (i.e. the unemployment rate)? Are prices rising across the economy (i.e. inflation)? If so, how fast/slow? Still, the work of epidemiologists and psychologists point us toward a different measure that seems to matter a great deal more to human life: income inequality. We will keep this measure close at hand as we work through these next few chapters. Our goal now is to understand the economic source of income inequality. Perhaps, if we can figure out where it comes from we might be able to figure out how to combat it. The tires are tricky one. If they are sold with the car, they are not a final good/service. But, if they are sold to a customer to replace an existing tire, they are a final good/service.↩︎ Look under the heading “Data by Topic” and then “Interactive Data”.
