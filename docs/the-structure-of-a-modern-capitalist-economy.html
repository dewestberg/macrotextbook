<p>Our social provisioning process, our economy, is organized around the private ownership of the means of production, markets, and purchased labor. This is <strong>Capitalism</strong>. One of the simplest but most powerful descriptions of the structure of Capitalism was delivered by the economist, Karl Marx (1867, Ch- 4 and 1885, Chapter 1). Here Marx used a schema that he referred to as the <em>The Circuit of Capital</em>. His circuit had three distinct stages of “Capital Accumulation”. Let’s explore those in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> A Capitalist uses money (M) to purchase labor power (LP) and the means of production (MP).</p>
<p>Stage 2: Labor power and the means of production are combined in the process of production to produce a commodity of greater “value” (C’) than that of its inputs.</p>
<p>Stage 3: The Capitalist takes the newly produced commodity to the market, selling it for more money (M’) than was originally invested (M).</p>
<p>The entire process is described by economic geographer and Marx scholar David Harvey as, “capital in motion.” Its central driving motivation, the force underpinning a functioning capitalist economy, is <em>the expectation of profit</em>.</p>
<p>Combining these stages, we see the system as a whole, but we can also begin to uncover the embedded social relations that Marx saw as fundamental to Capitalism. This is capital accumulation - the process of creating profit:</p>
<p>In the first stage of the process of capital accmnulation Capitalists make two important decisions. The first is whether or not to produce. Why would a Capitalist make this decision? Well, the schema tells us. Members of the Capitalist class will/should only engage in commodity creation if they expect to make more money (M’) than they initially invested (M). In other words, they would only engage in production if they expect to make profits. The second decision is a question of how to finance the project. Capitalists could get a loan from a bank, they could get seed money from equity investors, they could issue bonds, sell stocks, and even seek out venture capital (like on Shark Tank). If the Capitalist expects to make profits and is able to find financing, she then moves on to the second stage of capital accumulation: production.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the capitalist combines labor and the means of production to carry out the process of production; this takes time and emphasizes the role of labor and technology in production but also in Capitalism writ large. Considering the role of an economy in a society or culture, the position of labor in Capitalism is quite intriguing. Workers produce all of the goods and services that a society needs to fulfill its institutionalized daily tasks. They are critical to the production of goods and services necessary for society to reproduce itself. Without these workers (and the Capitalists that hired them), at least in this schematic, the society would not be able to reproduce itself as it was designed to do. This stage of production relies heavily on the workers (how healthy they are, how educated they are, how dependable they are, how happy they are etc.), the technology embedded within the means of production (machinery, equipment, buildings, land, public infrastructure, etc.), and the natural resources associated with that geographic space (climate, water quality, aesthetic appeal, etc.). Assuming the workers can do the work and are willing to do so at the wage on offer and that the means of production they are using are sufficient to produce the intended commodities, this second stage will proceed accordingly to stage three: consumption.</p>
<p>Finally, the third stage occurs when the capitalist takes the commodity created by the combination of labor and technology to the market. This stage is critical to the capitalist. She must sell the commodity for an amount of money that covers all of her prior expenses (M) and provides her with profits (M’ &gt; M). If this stage works properly, consumers (which are just workers after they’ve been paid) purchase the goods and services on offer at the prices required to create profit (M’ &gt; M). If successful, the members of society now have the goods and services they require to meet the needs of their social lives and continue the process of reproducing this society. This approach to describing the structure of the macro economy helps us consider three critical questions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How does this economic structure affect the social relations within that society?</li>
<li>What tensions or problems emerge from the ongoing reproduction of this chain of capital?</li>
<li>How does this system work on an interconnected global scale?</li>
</ol>
