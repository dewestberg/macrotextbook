<p>The process of production is at the core of your daily life, whether you know it or not. The time we get up, the way we interact with our friends and family, the types of jobs and careers we pursue are all intricately connected with the process of production in this Capitalist economy. The lives of people in developing countries are no different, but the process of production is. At its core, Capitalism is all about generating and reproducing dependent relationships. Those dependencies are critical to establishing and maintaining power dynamics. Let’s explore those dependencies in more detail.</p>
<div id="dependencies" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Dependencies<a href="the-social-relations-to-and-from-production.html#dependencies" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Stage 1: Financing<a href="the-social-relations-to-and-from-production.html#stage-1-financing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The fist stage of capital accumulation - financing - includes two actors: Capitalists and their financiers. Those financiers provide the liquidity to start the process of capital accumulation, and their money can come from a wide range of sources. The most common form of financing for small endeavors still is the traditional bank loan. But, firms can also use their own savings - called “retained earnings” - or they might issue bonds of their own. However, larger firms and firms in the fast paced world of start up enterprises often seek out non-bank equity investors. Each of these options requires different strategies, different types of projects, etc. But, the common thread between them is the financier is in the driver’s seat. The Capitalist is dependent upon the financial sector to gain access to the money she needs to get production up and running. This has several important implications for production (and consequently for daily life). First, the financial sector must be able to provide liquidity - money - to Capitalists. This means the financial sector must be “healthy” and must be willing to part with its own liquidity. Second, the financial sector is in a position to decide which projects get funding and which do not. Moreover, the financiers are in position to make demands on returns too. This may alter the Capitalist’s initial designs. Higher returns from investors may require Capitalists to cut costs, push more productivity from workers, use lower quality materials, etc. Finally, the financial sector must be trusted by the Capitalist enough to enter into a mutually-beneficial (one would expect) agreement.</p>
</div>
<div id="stage-2-production" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Stage 2: Production<a href="the-social-relations-to-and-from-production.html#stage-2-production" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The dependent relationships in stage two - production - are quite different. The production process relies directly on three distinct roles (capitalists, workers, and the owners of the necessary means of production (aka other Capitalists).). Capitalists must directly or indirectly oversee the production process. This includes hiring employees, managers, CEOs, etc. It also requires the development of rules and regulations that organize the working day and environment, the quality of the goods and services being produced, marketing plans, location decisions, etc. The list is expansive, but a good manager hires talented people to take over those roles. They hire employees with the technical skills, problem solving skills, and communication skills needed to do the job well, and try to maximize the difference between (M’ - M). The means of production that matter most are the tools workers use to produce the product. Whether these tools are hydraulic lifts, computers, software, fabric, sewing machines, paint, etc. the point is that the workers interact with these tools (including their physical work spaces) to engage in, and complete the production process. But, they are producing a product with someone else’s equipment. They are producing output that they do not own.</p>
<p>This stage represents a variety of dependencies. The first relationship exists clearly between the Capitalist and the worker. Without the Capitalist’s decision to engage in production and enter into an agreement with agents in the financial sector, the circuit of capital would not start in the first place, leaving the worker unemployed. Worse still, if the worker is unemployed they cannot get access to the money they need to live their social lives. This can be potentially devastating to the worker, but workers will also have people that depend on them (e.g. kids, partners, older parents, siblings with mental/physical disabilities, etc.). Capitalists, on the other hand, do not need income continuously over the span of, let’s say, a year. Unlike workers, profits usually are determined periodically throughout the year. Capitalists understand this and set up their social lives around this reality. Consequently, capitalists have much greater bargaining power in this relationship; they are in a position to wait.</p>
<p>There is also one critical external dependency that takes two forms. The first form is a relation to the broader economy. Capitalists are dependent upon markets to acquire the means of production that meet their technical requirements. They need to be able to find the materials, machines, locations, etc. that ensure their workers will be able to produce the desired output. Hence, a well-functiomng economy will create diverse and accessible markets that will provide affordable inputs into the production process. The second form is a relation to the broader society, particularly the health and education systems. Capitalists need workers that can do the job. They must be physically well enough to show up on a regular basis and perform the work. They also must have the knowledge, skills, and work expectations that the commodity requires in its production process.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Stage 3: Consumption<a href="the-social-relations-to-and-from-production.html#stage-3-consumption" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The final stage of the circuit of capital is the sale and consumption of the Capitalist’s commodity to its consumer. This stage depends almost exclusively on the Capitalist and the Consumer. On the surface, the Capitalist has to produce a commodity that consumer will actually buy. She must also set it at a price consumers will be willing and able to pay. In this sense, Capitalists are quite dependent upon consumers desires and financial abilities. However, consumers rely heavily on Capitalists too. Consumers are simply workers by another name. If they are to be purchase the products they helped produce, they must first get paid enough by the Capitalist to do so.</p>
